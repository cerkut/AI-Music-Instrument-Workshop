## Onto Deep Learning (Discriminative, Generative)
![Deep Learning](image/README/DL-Discriminative.png)

- https://playground.tensorflow.org/
    - [ ] Tinker with the defalult example: What are features, learning rate, activation functions?
    - [ ] Challenge: Can you create a neural network that only uses the first 2 features as input, and linear as the activation function?

# What is hot

## Classical Electronic Music for Modern AI

![FM](image/README/anim_vae01.gif)

ðŸš€ [Juan Alonso Moreno](https://github.com/juanalonso) has developed a differentiable FM synthesizer using the DDSP framework in his 2021 SMC Master thesis 

- Audio [https://juanalonso.github.io/ddsp_fm/](https://juanalonso.github.io/ddsp_fm/)
- Code [https://juanalonso.github.io/ddsp_fm/](https://github.com/juanalonso/ddsp_fm)

[Franco Caspe](https://fcaspe.github.io/), a PhD student from QMUL has interesting related projects. There is a [new book and repo](https://github.com/yeeking/ai-enhanced-audio-book) by Yee-King you can use to combine the power of deep learning and the real-time capabilities of the JUCE platform.

ðŸ’¿ DATA: Miller S Puckette [in his Pd Repertory Project](https://msp.ucsd.edu/pdrp/) provides example study patches of important electronic / computer music projects. [Stefano Fasciani (U. Oslo)](https://github.com/stefanofasciani/DGMD) is actively working on a dataset generator for musical devices. 

Starting from these models ðŸš€ and data ðŸ’¿, can you design and evaluate an end-to-end differentiable synthesizer? 

## Quantum Sound and Music Computing
Denmark has a rich history of innovation in Quantum research, and aims to a big player in Quantum Computing. There is a [growing community, a national strategy, talent programs, and resources available](https://dqc.dk/) for the next generation of Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning professionals. Outside of Denmark, startups like [Moth Quantum](https://mothquantum.com/) strive to enable the next era of music, gaming and the arts with quantum computing technology.

## Music making & production systems

### AIVA 

- Main: https://aiva.ai/
- Release discord: https://discord.com/channels/595651381860368384/596767903215255572
- Tutorial list @ YouTube
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR-UWkSTmAQ&list=PLv7BOfa4CxsHp4uDdsmZgpdclrwkdMpOe

#### AIVA TODO

- Check Terms and Conditions and create an account
- Generate 3 versions of a compositions on the web interface
- Open the best one in Editor and edit to improve
- Use an influence, repeat to last steps above for another composition
- Identify the Model / Data / Code structure
- Show and tell: including influence and ethics
- Download your work as MIDI (we'll use in 1.3 onwards)

### 2.4 DAW Plugins

- Main: https://interactiveaudiolab.github.io/project/audacity.html
- Download special build of audactiy (Mac only ???)
- Try Usage Example - Upmixing and Remixing with Source Separation with your favorite audio file
- Try adding vocals to your AIVA composition. We have to match the pitch, tempo, harmony, or other attributes with effects.
